# Arbitrum Analytics (Capstone Project)
Arbitrum Analytics is a website designed to provide users with comprehensive insights into various protocols built on the Arbitrum network. The platform allows users to explore and analyze different Arbitrum protocols, offering valuable data such as Total Value Locked (TVL), token prices, trade volumes, and market capitalization (MCAP). By aggregating and presenting this information in an intuitive interface, Arbitrum Analytics enables users to gain a deeper understanding of the performance and trends within the Arbitrum ecosystem.

In addition to the analytics features, the website also offers a personalized experience by allowing users to create an account and add protocols to their favorites. This feature enables users to easily track and monitor their preferred protocols, keeping them informed about important updates and changes in real-time.

Arbitrum Analytics serves as a one-stop platform for users interested in the Arbitrum network, empowering them with the data and tools necessary to make informed decisions, discover new opportunities, and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the Arbitrum ecosystem.
